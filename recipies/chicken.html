    <h2>How to make Chickn Pesto</h2>
    <ol> 
   <li>Preheat the oven to 400F. Cut the chicken breasts into two smaller cutlets lengthwise, and season them with garlic powder and salt & pepper. Pan fry until golden brown.

</li>
   <li>Transfer chicken to a plate, and add to the skillet the garlic, broth, tomatoes, pesto, and Italian seasoning. Cook until the tomatoes start to lose their firmness and release juice.

</li>
   <li>Add the chicken back into the skillet, and sprinkle the mozzarella on top of the chicken breasts. Bake for 5 minutes, and then carefully broil it for a few more. 
       Garnish with fresh basil if using it, and serve immediately!
